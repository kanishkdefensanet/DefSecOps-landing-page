# Welcome to your DefSecOps project

**DefSecOps as a Service** is a fully managed, end-to-end solution that integrates **Development (Dev)**, **Security (Sec)**, and **Operations (Ops)** into a unified, automated pipeline.  
We enable organizations to **secure software delivery from code to cloud**, reducing vulnerabilities, meeting compliance requirements, and accelerating release cycles — all without the overhead of building internal security teams from scratch.
